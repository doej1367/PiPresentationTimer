# PiPresentationTimer
A small circle that slowly fills red in a set timeframe to have a better overview over the time left in a presentation.

It sits on the upper left side of the screen, partially transparent.

The controlls are easy:
Left-Click: Timer reset
Right-Click: Options menu to set a different duration or close the application
